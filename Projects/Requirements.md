**Project 1: Constraining modified gravity with large scale structure**

  Requirements (software):
  
  CosmoMC, getdist (comes with CosmoMC, needs Python 2.7+ or 3.4+), MGCAMB
  (CosmoMC comes with CAMB and I want the students to implement the MG files so this doesn’t need to be ‘installed’ only downloaded)
     
**Project 2: Learning Galaxy Formation from Large-scale Structure and Weak Lensing**

  Requirements (software):
  
  Python, numpy, scipy, h5py, your favorite HMF and cosmology code (type "halo mass function” into github).
